I’m alright thanks, just trying to get the first version of this notam thing reduced down to the most basic version possible.
So we basically want to create a site where people can submit their own bits of information about an airport or airspace they know about.
 With maybe an ‘About’ button too

Here’s the first draft of the Typeform page we would want to embed:
https://davidmumford.typeform.com/to/LKlyZD (edited)

When people enter info there, it loads into a Google Sheets doc. We then want this to feed the ‘Latest updates’ and ‘Search’ boxes.

But we also want to make it so that the only people who can enter information do so by either:
a. clicking on a private link to the site that we send them in an email, and/or
b. going to the website directly and putting in their email address
Only these people can enter info. Everybody else can just view only.
